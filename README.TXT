"Tic Tac Toe" v2.5 by Anthony
JS & HTML & CSS meeting together cleanly

What is working?
- Nice UI
- Human vs Random Bot
- Victory & Tie detection
- Count wins

Known bugs:
- A win on the first column isn't detected. Likely a typo in my Victory detection algo.
- CPU played two times in a row?

Things I struggled with, on which I'd love some feedback/assistance:
- Sizing in CSS :o
- Alignment in CSS :o
- Formatting and structure of files (JS & CSS)

Potential next steps:
- Smarter CPU
    - In progress: 
        - Need to compare playedMoves with winning situations, to know where to attack
        - Compare oponent playedMoves with winning situations, to know where to defend
        - Based on info above, select move
- Factor some functions
- Host it online

Any feedback to improve the code is more than welcomed!!

Thank you dear readers <3
